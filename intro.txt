In a advancing world, computer performance grows faster every day.

Introduced with good intent, it wasn't long before people discovered technology could be exploited for bad.
Cyber security firms stepped up to help protect valuable data and servers, but it was too much.
Hackers were everywhere, both amateur and professional. 

And so the government invented a new scheme. A competition, known as...

|_|  _.  _ |   _  ._   \     / _. ._ _ 
|  | (_| (_ |< (/_ |     \/\/ (_| | _> 
                                       
Open to all hackers; professional, hacktivists and even script kiddies
join in to complete. A simple game of elimination in which each hacker would
engage in... player to player combat between two or more computers. First to
gain control and destroy their opponent's computer wins!

I wonder if I could compete this year...
