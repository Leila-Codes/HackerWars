        <body>Hi there #PLAYERNAME#,

I'm John Tovar, the head administrator here at Hacker Wars. I just wanted to take a moment to welcome you to the competition!

Getting setup with our servers shouldn't be too difficult for a Hacker like you.

The Hacker Wars systems has grown a lot this year, we have our own news coverage server and a brand-new discussion board for both competitors and viewers.

I've linked all our services below, and provided your new account details to the battleboard daemon.

Best of luck out there,
 John Tovar   |   CEO Hacker Wars
