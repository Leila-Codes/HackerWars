        <body>#PLAYERNAME#,

Battleboard automated systems have detected that you have lost a recent battle.

Under Hacker_Wars ruling you are allowed to re-attempt the battle, but only if you can recover your system to a usable state.

Use your BACKUP server to restore your x-server and/or executables.

Once you're back online, head back to the battleboard to retry your last battle.
