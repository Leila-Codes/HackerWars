        <body>Hello there,

We don't know each other very well just yet, but I do know you got rejected from joining the Hacker Wars competition this year.

 Perhaps you wanted a challenge?
 Was looking to prove yourself? 
 Or perhaps you're more of the show-off type?

Whatever your reasons, I think I can help you.

That's right, let's HACK you a place into Hacker Wars #PLAYERNAME#! Kind of ironic, don't you think?


Before we get started, I wonder if your toolsets and skills are up-to-date?

Why don't you show me what you've got and grab yourself some tools on my server? 
I've attached a link below.
