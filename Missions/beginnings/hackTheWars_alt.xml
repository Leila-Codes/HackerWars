        <body>Hey if you wanna go charging in without any backups, who am I to stop you?

Be sure to upload any new tools you might find along the way, you don't want to lose those files either!

It's taken some digging, but I think I have a way into the Hacker Wars DB. IP attached below.

You'll need to get admin access to the server before we can make any... "updates"

Do that first while I find us someone you can replace...
