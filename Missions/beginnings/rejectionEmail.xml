        <body>Dear #PLAYERNAME#,

Thank you for sending in your request to compete for the 
 Hacker Wars competition this year.

As you'll no doubt be surprised, a lot requests were received this year,
 following the success of last years competition.

Unfortunately due to the volume of requests, yours has not been accepted.

We hope you will re-submit again next year!

Sincerely,  
    Judith Thomas   |    Hacker Wars Centre Coordinator
