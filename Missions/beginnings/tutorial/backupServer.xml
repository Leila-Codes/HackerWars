        <body>Excellent #PLAYERNAME#!

Then let's get you setup with something crucial for the competition.

You need yourself a BACKUP server. Somewhere you can securely store important files!

Your EXEs and X-Server.sys could be tampered with or deleted so it's best to have a spare ready for you.

I've already set a server up, and linked the IP below. Login and upload your important files!

Let me know when you're ready to proceed.

> NOTE: This mission is skippable, simply reply "done" to advance.
WARNING: if you do NOT backup your files, you risk getting stuck later in the game.
