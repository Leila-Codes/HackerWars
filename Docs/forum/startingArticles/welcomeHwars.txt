>Welcome to the second year...

Holy moly I'm excited! They had some crazy
hackers out there last year. Yeah, you 
remember when that guy took the entire
elgoog server down?

>that guy took the entire elgoog server...

Wait! He did what now? OMG!!
------------------------------------------
>Wait! He did what now? OMG!!

Now now, no need for all that language
is there? Though I have to admit that
was veryy impressive!
------------------------------------------
>no need for all that language

There's always one person in the thread... 
banging on about language!
------------------------------------------
>There's always one person...

Of course! No forum is complete without
that someone... Even if they are 
annoying.
